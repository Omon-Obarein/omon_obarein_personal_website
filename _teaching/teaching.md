## 🎓 Teaching Experience

I am deeply passionate about **teaching and mentoring** the next generation of geographers, data scientists, and spatial analysts.  
My teaching philosophy blends **practical skill-building**, **critical thinking**, and **real-world applications** of geospatial methods to solve pressing global challenges in health, population, and environment.  

Over the years, I have taught and assisted in a variety of courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels, spanning GIS, geography, and spatial statistics.
