**Count-Down to 2030 – Geospatial Modelling of Maternal Health Outcomes Across Sub-Saharan Africa (Lead Modeller)**  
This project supports the global Countdown to 2030 initiative, which tracks progress toward maternal and child health targets. I led spatial statistical modelling to understand the distribution of antenatal care visits and malaria prevalence among pregnant women across Sub-Saharan Africa. The outputs provide critical evidence to guide interventions and policies to improve maternal health outcomes.
