I am deeply committed to **capacity strengthening and knowledge exchange** in geospatial data science, spatial epidemiology, population modelling, and statistical methods.  
Over the years, I have designed and facilitated workshops for **universities, national statistical offices (NSOs), and international organisations**, empowering participants to apply cutting-edge methods for research, census planning, and policy development.  

Below is a selection of training and workshops I have conducted:

---

## 📊 Introduction to R for Statistical Analysis  
**Audience:** Postgraduate Students, University of Southampton  
**Dates:** February 2024 & May 2025  

This workshop provided postgraduate students with a **hands-on introduction to R programming**, focusing on data wrangling, visualization, and statistical modelling.  
The sessions aimed to **build confidence in using R** for academic research and professional applications, helping participants transition from traditional statistical packages to open-source tools.

## 🌍 Bottom-up Gridded Population Modelling Workshop  
**Host:** Statistical Institute of Jamaica  
**Date:** March 2025  

A technical workshop introducing methods for **bottom-up population modelling** using survey and microcensus data.  
Participants explored how gridded population estimates can be developed to fill data gaps, supporting **national planning, disaster preparedness, and health service delivery**.

## 🌏 Gridded Population Modelling Workshop  
**Host:** Cameroon National Statistical Office (NSO)  
**Date:** April 2024  

This training built **national capacity in spatial demography**, focusing on **geostatistical approaches** to produce high-resolution population estimates.  
The workshop strengthened collaboration between researchers and government statisticians in applying innovative modelling for **census planning and SDG monitoring**.

## 🌏 Spatial Population Modelling Training  
**Host:** Thailand National Statistical Office  
**Date:** November 2023  

A capacity-building programme equipping statisticians with skills in **spatial modelling and geostatistical methods**.  
The training emphasized **practical applications of gridded population data** for use in official statistics, improving national datasets for development planning.

## 🌎 Modelled Population Estimates and National Sampling Frames  
**Audience:** Census Teams & NSOs across Latin America and the Caribbean  
**Date:** June 2023  

This regional training provided technical guidance on using **modelled population datasets** to strengthen **sampling frames** for household surveys and censuses.  
It fostered peer-learning among multiple countries and promoted the use of **open data and reproducible workflows**.

## ♍️ Capacity-Strengthening Workshop on Population Modelling  
**Host:** Nigeria Population Commission  
**Date:** February 2023  

Delivered to senior staff and technical experts, this workshop introduced **modern approaches to population estimation** using geospatial data.  
The sessions demonstrated how modelled estimates can **bridge census gaps** and support **evidence-based policy** in public health and development.
