I'm Dr. Ortis Yankey, a passionate geospatial modeller and population health researcher, currently serving as a Research Fellow with the WorldPop Research Group at the University of Southampton. My work sits at the intersection of data science, public health, and spatial analytics—leveraging machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and GIS to tackle some of the most pressing global challenges.

I have led and contributed to high-impact projects across Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean—developing small-area population estimates, mapping vaccination coverage, and supporting national census improvements. My methodological expertise spans advanced statistical modelling, spatial demography, and the integration of geospatial, survey, and administrative data.

A core part of my career has also been dedicated to knowledge exchange and capacity building. I’ve trained personnel from national statistics offices in countries such as Cameroon, Jamaica, Nigeria, and Thailand on modern approaches to geospatial population modelling and data science with R and GIS.

My academic background includes a Ph.D. in Geography from Kent State University (USA), an MSc in GIS from the University of Akron, and a master’s degree in Urbanisation and Development from the London School of Economics. I have authored and co-authored several peer-reviewed publications, including in Nature Communications, BMC Women's Health, and Applied Geography.

I am driven by a desire to make data work for people—ensuring that policymakers, health systems, and humanitarian actors have the evidence they need to make informed decisions. Whether through research, teaching, or collaboration, I’m committed to using geospatial data science to improve lives and transform communities.
