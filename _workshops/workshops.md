# Workshops & Training

I am deeply committed to **capacity strengthening and knowledge exchange** in geospatial data science, population modelling, and statistical methods.  
Over the years, I have designed and facilitated workshops for **universities, national statistical offices (NSOs), and international organisations**, empowering participants to apply cutting-edge methods for research, census planning, and policy development.  

Below is a selection of training and workshops I have conducted:

---

## 📊 Introduction to R for Statistical Analysis  
**Audience:** Postgraduate Students, University of Southampton  
**Dates:** February 2024 & May 2025  

This workshop provided postgraduate students with a **hands-on introduction to R programming**, focusing on data wrangling, visualization, and statistical modelling.  
The sessions aimed to **build confidence in using R** for academic research and professional applications, helping participants transition from traditional statistical packages to open-source tools.
