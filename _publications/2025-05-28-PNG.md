excerpt: 'This study introduces a two-step Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach to generate reliable small area population estimates in settings where traditional census data are outdated or incomplete. By integrating routinely collected health intervention campaign data with partially observed satellite-derived settlement information, the method overcomes limitations posed by microcensus logistics and obscured satellite imagery in tropical rural regions. The model achieved a 32–73% reduction in relative error in simulations and approximately 32% when applied to real-world malaria survey data in Papua New Guinea. These findings demonstrate the potential of leveraging routine demographic data to improve population estimates, especially where satellite data are compromised.'

**Abstract**

Effective governance requires timely and reliable small area population counts. 
Geospatial modelling approaches which utilise bespoke microcensus surveys and satellite-derived 
settlement maps and other spatial datasets have been developed to fill population data gaps in countries
where censuses are outdated and incomplete. However, logistics and costs of microcensus surveys and tree
canopy or cloud cover obscuring settlements in satellite images limit its wider applications in tropical
rural settings. Here, we present a two-step Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach that can integrate 
routinely collected health intervention campaign data and partially observed settlement data to produce 
reliable small area population estimates. Reductions in relative error rates were 32–73% in a simulation
study, and ~32% when applied to malaria survey data in Papua New Guinea. The results highlight the value 
of demographic data routinely collected through health intervention campaigns or household surveys for 
improving small area population estimates, and how biases introduced by satellite data limitations can 
be overcome.
